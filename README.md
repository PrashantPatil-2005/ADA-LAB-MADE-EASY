# ADA Lab Programs – VTU 4th Sem (C)

This repository contains simple and easy-to-understand C implementations of all the ADA (Analysis and Design of Algorithms) lab programs for VTU's 4th semester syllabus. The main goal is to help students quickly grasp the core logic of each algorithm without getting lost in complexity.

If you're preparing for lab exams or just want a quick refresher, this should help.

Each program is made to be:

- Simple and beginner-friendly
- Easy to read and modify
- Focused on the main logic without unnecessary extras
